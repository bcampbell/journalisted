notes on getting a local install of journalisted.com up and running...


Prequisites
-----------

apache
 - version not too important
 - need mod_rewrite, php
 - other webservers might work (eg IIS)

postgresql
 - not too fussy about version (Currently using 8.2)

php
 - php5 (php4 _might_ work also...)
 - postgresql bindings
 - HTML_QuickForm (used by admin pages only)
 - needs to be able to run from commandline, as well as webserver

python
 - psycopg2 postgresql bindings (we used to use PyPgSQL)
 - yaml
 - lots of other stuff no doubt :-)

mySociety phplib and pylib
 - available from their github commonlib repo

xapian (for the full text index)
 - php5 bindings
 - python bindings

On Ubuntu/Debian, this basically boils down to:
$ apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-php5 postgresql php5 php5-cli php5-pgsql python-psycopg2 python-yaml php5-xapian python-xapian xapian-tools
$ git clone ....
$ cd journalisted
$ git clone https://github.com/mysociety/commonlib.git
$ ln -s commonlib/phplib .
$ ln -s commonlib/pylib .

PHP-XAPIAN BINDINGS ISSUE
-------------------------

There's a problem with the xapian php bindings, due to some license
issue with php...
details here:
 http://trac.xapian.org/ticket/191

Instructions on building a php5-xapian package manually for debian
and ubuntu are maintained here:
 http://trac.xapian.org/wiki/FAQ/PHP%20Bindings%20Package


DB Setup
--------

We're using postgres 9.2.
See db/INSTALL for details.


Nginx
-----

We've switched from apache to nginx.
There's an example config in nginx/journalisted.com


PHP
---

Run "php --ini" to locate the configuration file to change.
Make sure it has these settings set:

  ; Enable the PHP scripting language engine under Apache.
  engine = On
  
  ; Allow using "<?" to open PHP script blocks.
  short_open_tag = On

  ; A deprecated feature that we use (pass-by-reference in function calls).
  allow_call_time_pass_reference = On
TODO: think it might work now without this option

  ; We don't currently support running in PHP's Safe Mode sandbox.
  safe_mode = Off

  ; to run under php 5.4 we need to set a default timezone for DateTime objects
  date.timezone = UTC

Site Config
-----------

 $ cp conf/general.example conf/general

Check settings in conf/general. In particular, check the postgresql port
number against your postgresql.conf
