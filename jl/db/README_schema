The article table is the core of the whole system. All the scraped articles
are stored there, and most other data in the system is derived from them.


article table
-------------


id (integer, primary key, not null)
  The unique id for the article.


title (text, not null)
  The article headline. Single line, utf-8, plain text.


byline (text, not null)
 The article byline as scraped (eg "By Fred Smith, Washington
 and Fred Bloggs, Political Correspondent"). Single line, utf-8,
 plain text.


description (text, not null)
 Short description of the article (utf-8, plain text)


pubdate (timestamp)
 When the article was published (or when the article claims it was published).
Different outlets do things a bit differently. For example, one paper might
only have dates, so all the articles will appear to show up at midnight.
It's a bit rough.


firstseen (timestamp, not null)
 When the article is first seen by the scraper. The idea is that firstseen
and lastseen can track the period the article was active, as the scrapers
are run regularly.
For historical archives, it's probably better for firstseen/lastseen to be
set to the pubdate, rather than the time they were scraped.


lastseen (timestamp, not null)
 The last time the article was seen by the scrapers.
Currently the scrapers don't correctly update this after the initial scrape.
But the idea is that this'll be updated so that we get an idea of how long
the article was active on the source site...


content (text)
 The actual article text (utf-8). Uses a very cut-down set of HTML, with
very basic formatting (<p>, <br>, <strong>, headings etc). The scrapers
should remove most style fluff and just leave the text and it's basic
structure.

permalink (text, not null)
 URL to original article. Might be different to the one scraped (eg
we might find it easier to scrape the printer version of an article).
This is the URL we serve up to the user when they want to read the
original article.

srcurl (text, not null)
 The original url which we scraped the article from. Usually the same as
permalink, but doesn't have to be.

srcorg (integer, not null)
 The ID of the organisation the article came from (foreign key - indexes
into the "organisation" table).

srcid (text, not null)
 A unique ID which identifies the article within the source organisation.
 srcorg + srcid together should form a unique indentifier for the article
 over the whole database.
 Often, srcid can just be the same as srcurl, but not always. Some
 sites have multiple urls pointing at the same article.
 Often, sites expose their internal database IDs in the URL. If this is
 the case, then it makes sense to extract this from the url and use it
 as the srcid.
 eg:
 http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/article3061121.ece
 For this independent url, it's pretty obvious that 3061121 is their
 internal database id.

lastscraped (timestamp)
 When the article was last scraped

wordcount (integer)
 Number of words in the article.

status ( character(1), default 'a' )
 'a'=active
 Any other value means article is hidden and not included in analysis.
 'd'=duplicate
