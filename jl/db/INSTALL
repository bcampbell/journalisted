DATABASE SETUP
--------------

These notes apply to Postgres 9.4 on debian 8 (Jessie).
Applies mostly to other versions of pg and ubuntu/debian,
but bound to be a few differences here and there...

Assumes we're running a database called "jl", with a postgres user
called "jl" and a unix account with the username "jl".



Set up Postgres for UTF8 encoding
---------------------------------

On Ubuntu & Debian, the default postgres cluster is set up for SQL_ASCII
encoding.
An easy way to switch to UTF-8 is to drop the cluster just after installation
and recreate it using pg_dropcluster/pg_createcluster.

GOTCHA: pg_createcluster will use the default locale. SSH forwards your
local locale LC_* vars over to remote sessions by default. If you're in
a different country to the server this might not be what you want.
eg I'm in New Zealand (en_NZ) but server should be UK locale (en_GB)
pg_createcluster does have a --locale option, but it doesn't work as of
postgresql 9.2
(see http://www.postgresql.org/message-id/5195FA83.9010604@imos.net ).
Workaround is to manually set your locale before invoking pg_createcluster
eg:

    $ export LANG=en_GB.utf-8
    $ export LC_ALL=en_GB.utf-8

    $ sudo -u postgres pg_dropcluster --stop 9.4 main
    $ sudo -u postgres pg_createcluster -e UTF-8 9.4 main



Create the postgres user and database
-------------------------------------

$ sudo -u postgres createuser jl
$ sudo -u postgres createdb -O jl -E utf8 jl

(or $ sudo -u postgres createdb -O jl -E utf8 -T template0 jl
if your cluster is still set to SQL_ASCII)


Authentication
--------------

The "jl" unix user should have access to the "jl" postgres user by
virtue of sharing the same name.
However, you'd usually want to add another user who can connect and use
the "jl" postgresq user. You can set up a jldev group to add such users
like this (to let unix account "ben" connect to the jl postgres account):

add to pg_ident.conf:
jldev           ben                     jl

add to pg_hba.conf (at the top):
local   jl          jl peer map=jldev
