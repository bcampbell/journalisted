<h2>Development</h2>

Journa-list is an open source project.

<p>
The main project page is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/journa-list/">here</a> (hosted at code.google.com).
</p>

<p>
Currently, documentation on how the code works is a little... ummm... thin on the ground :-)
This will be remedied in future. For now, if you have technical questions,
your best bet is to contact <a href="http://scumways.com">Ben Campbell</a>,
who coded most of it.
